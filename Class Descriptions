How the creatures are chosen from the cup
-----------------------------------------
1) Generate a random number between 1 and the number of creatures left in the cup
	- Move the values of in-use creatures to the back and shift all other indices up one
2) The random number will be used as the index in each of the arrays, which are then passed to a constructor to generate the creature

DICE
(Dice.java)
 - int roll(): generates a random number from 1-6
